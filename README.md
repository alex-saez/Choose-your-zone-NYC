### Choose-your-zone-NYC

+ Summary: 

This web app (still in progress) is meant to help users find an ideal New York City area to live in according to user-defined preferences. The app consists of a dynamic map of New York City and a control panel where the user can define their preferences. These preferences are tunable using sliders that control the weight assigned to each desirable feature. For example, one user might give more importance to transportation and proximity to bars and restaurants while another user might value good public schools and proximity to parks instead. Once these preferences have been entered, the app updates a heat map of the city with city-block-resolution in which warm colors indicate sub-neighborhoods that most closely match the userâ€™s criteria. In its current version, only Transportaion and School Quality are available.
