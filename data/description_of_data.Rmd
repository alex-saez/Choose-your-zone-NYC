The great majority of the data used for this project will be obtained from [NYC Open Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/), a project intended to make New York City data available for public use. Here's the site's own description:

*"NYC Open Data makes the wealth of public data generated by various New York City agencies and other City organizations available for public use. As part of an initiative to improve the accessibility, transparency, and accountability of City government, this catalog offers access to a repository of government-produced, machine-readable data sets."*
